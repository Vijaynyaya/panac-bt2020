A dashboard like frontend that displays key statistics regarding COVID-19. Data is sourced from disease.sh

I need help regarding making [Bing's COVID-19 widget](https://github.com/microsoft/COVID-19-Widget), which is primarily designed for normal(static) html webpages, compatible with React. In other words, how can we convert a html-javascript widget into react-compatible, reusable jsx?
