The component Sentence takes several lexical categories such as verb, subject, object, etc as props to fit them in a predefined sentence structure like subject + verb + object. 

For intance:

  ```<Sentence subject="Aurangzeb" adverb="" verb="imprisoned" adjective="" object="his own father" />```

outputs: "Aurangzeb imprisoned his own father."
