import React from 'react';

const Map = () => {
    return (<div> Map <br /> // TO BE IMPLEMENTED <br /> 
    I need help regarding making <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/COVID-19-Widget"> Bing's COVID-19 widget </a>, which is primarily designed for normal(static) html webpages, compatible with React. In other words, how can we convert a html-javascript widget into react-compatible, reusable jsx?</div>)
}

export default Map;
